To build the package, there is no need to run the configure script.  Just
use the standard cabal commands:

    runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
    runhaskell Setup.lhs build
    runhaskell Setup.lhs install
    
The package uses a script to find what CBLAS library to link with.  To link
with a custom CBLAS, add the "--with-cblas=<lib>" argument to 
--configure-option,
e.g

    runhaskell Setup.lhs configure --configure-option="--with-cblas=<lib>"

To build this package from the repository, first run
    aclocal -I m4
    autoreconf
